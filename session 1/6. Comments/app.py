# Concept:
# Comments are short notes placed in different parts of a program, 
# explaining how those parts of the program work.


# In Python, you begin a comment with the # character. When the Python 
# interpreter sees a character, it ignores everything from that character 
# to the end of the line.



# Comments in lists

# Comments in parameters

# Comments at end of lines
