### Sales Tax
# Write a program that will ask the user to enter the amount of a purchase. 
# The program should then compute the state and county sales tax. Assume the 
# state sales tax is 5 percent and the county sales tax is 2.5 percent. 
# The program should display the amount of the purchase, the state sales tax, 
# the county sales tax, the total sales tax, and the total of the sale (which is 
# the sum of the amount of purchase plus the total sales tax).
#
# Hint: Use the value 0.025 to represent 2.5 percent, and 0.05 to represent 5 percent.

### Tip, Tax, and Total
# Write a program that calculates the total amount of a meal purchased at a 
# restaurant. The program should ask the user to enter the charge for the food, 
# then calculate the amounts of a 18 percent tip and 7 percent sales tax.
# Display each of these amounts and the total.

### Male and Female Percentages - (You should apply what you learned about percentages
# with f-strings in this excercise)
# Write a program that asks the user for the number of males and the number of 
# females registered in a class. The program should display the percentage of 
# males and females in the class.
#
# Hint: Suppose there are 8 males and 12 females in a class. There are 20 students in the
# class. The percentage of males can be calculated as 8 ÷ 20 = 0.4, or 40%. 
# The percentage of females can be calculated as 12 ÷ 20 = 0.6, or 60%.
