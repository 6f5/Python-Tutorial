# Seesion 1 - Introduces the program development cycle, variables, data types, and simple
# programs that are written as sequence structures. You'll learn to write simple programs
# that read input from the keyboard, perform mathematical operations, and produce formatted
# screen output. Pseudocode and flowcharts are also introduced as tools for designing programs.
# This session also includes an optional introduction to the turtle graphics library.


# ***
# Statements in the program execute in the order that they appear.


# ========================== Concepts ==========================
#
# Designing a Program
# - Programs must be carefully designed before they are written. During
# the design process, programmers use tools such as pseudocode and
# flowcharts to create models of programs.
#
#
# Input, Processing, and Output
# - Input is data that the program receives. When a program receives data,
# it usually processes it by performing some operation with it. The result
# of the operation is sent out of the program as output.
#
#
# Displaying Output with the print Function
# - You use the print function to display output in a Python program.
#
#
# Comments
# - Comments are notes of explanation that document lines or sections of a
# program. Comments are part of the program, but the Python interpreter
# ignores them. They are intended for people who may be reading the
# source code.
#
#
# Variables
# - A variable is a name that represents a storage location in the computer’s
# memory.
#
#
# Reading Input from the Keyboard
# - Programs commonly need to read input typed by the user on the keyboard. 
# We will use the Python functions to do this.
#
#
# Performing Calculations
# - Python has numerous operators that can be used to perform mathematical
# calculations.
#
#
# String Concatenation
# - String concatenation is the appending of one string to the end of another.
#
#
# Displaying Formatted Output with F-strings
# - F-strings are a special type of string literal that allow you to format
# values in a variety of ways.
#
#
# Named Constants
# - A named constant is a name that represents a special value, such as a
# magic number.
#
#
# Turtle Graphics
# - Turtle graphics is an interesting and easy way to learn basic programming concepts. The Python turtle graphics system simulates a “turtle”
# that obeys commands to draw simple graphics.
#
#


# *** Important Terms ***
# ========================== Terminology ==========================
# input: Data or values that are provided to a program from outside sources, 
# such as a user typing into a keyboard or a file being read from disk.
#
# output: Data or values that a program produces as a result of processing 
# input, such as printing a message to the screen or writing a file to disk.
#
# variable: A variable is a name that represents a value in the computer’s memory. 
#
# function: A function is a piece of prewritten code that performs an operation.
#
# calling: When programmers execute a function, they say that they are calling the function.
#
# parameter: A variable in a function or method definition that represents a value or a 
# reference passed to the function or method when it is called.
#
# argument: The actual value or reference that is passed to the function or method 
# when it is called, corresponding to a parameter in the function or method definition.
#
# string: A sequence of characters that is used as data is called a string.
#
# string literal: When a string appears in the actual code of a program, it is called a string literal.
#
# end-line comment: A comment that appears at the end of a line of code.
#
# references: When a variable represents a value in the computer’s memory, 
#
# we say that the variable references the value.
#
# statement: A unit of code in a programming language that performs a specific 
# action, such as assigning a value to a variable or branching to a different 
# section of code based on a condition.
#
# expression: A unit of code in a programming language that produces a value, 
# such as a mathematical calculation or a reference to a variable.
#
# garbage collection: When a value in memory is no longer referenced by
# a variable, the Python interpreter automatically removes it from memory through a process
# known as garbage collection.
#
# numeric literal: A number that is written into a program’s code is called a numeric literal. 
#
# exception:  An exception is an unexpected error that occurs while a program is running,
# causing the program to halt if the error is not properly dealt with.
#
# operands: The values on the right and left of the + operator are called operands.
#
# truncated: means that its fractional part is thrown away.
#
# mixed-type expression: An expression that uses operands of different data types is 
# called a mixed-type expression.
#
# newline character: You do not see the newline character, but when it is displayed, 
# it causes the output to advance to the next line. 
# 
# escape character: An escape character is a special character that is preceded 
# with a backslash (\), appearing inside a string literal. When a string literal 
# that contains escape characters is printed, the escape characters are treated 
# as special commands that are embedded in the string.
#
# magic number: A magic number is an unexplained value that appears in a program’s code.
#
# named constant: A named constant is a name that represents a special value.
#
# pseudocode: The word “pseudo” means fake, so pseudocode is fake code.
#
# flowchart: A flowchart is a diagram that graphically depicts the steps 
# that take place in a program.
#
# immutable: An immutable object is an object that cannot be modified after it 
# has been created. 
#
# mutable: A mutable object is an object that can be modified after it has been 
# created.
#
#
# iterable: an iterable is any object that can be looped over. It is an object 
# that can return its elements one at a time, in a sequence, when a loop or a 
# function that uses iteration is applied to it.
