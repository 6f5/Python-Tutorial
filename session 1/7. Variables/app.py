# Variables
# variable: a name that represents a value in the computer’s memory.
# reference: When a variable represents a value in the computer’s memory, we say that the 
# variable references the value.

# Creating Variables with Assignment Statements
# You use an assignment statement to create a variable and make it reference a piece of data.
# total ----------> 1000
total = 1000

# General Format
# variable = expression
# ** WARNING: You cannot use a variable until you have assigned a value to it. **


# Common Errors:
# Misspelled variable name
# Inconsistent use of case


# ** important **:
# Python variables work differently than variables in most other
# programming languages. In most programming languages, a variable is a memory location that holds a value. In those languages, when you assign a value to a variable, the
# value is stored in the variable’s memory location.
#
# In Python, however, a variable is a memory location that holds the address of another
# memory location. When you assign a value to a Python variable, that value is stored in
# a location that is separate from the variable. The variable will hold the address of the
# memory location that holds the value. That is why, in Python, instead of saying that a
# variable “holds” a value, we say that a variable “references” a variable.


# Variable Naming Rules
# Cannot use Python's keywords
# Cannot contain spaces
# First character must be one of the letters a-z, A-Z, or an underscore
# After the first character you may use the letters a-z,A-Z, the digits 0-9, or underscores
# Uppercase and lowercase characters are distinct
# ** choose names for your variables that give an indication of what they are used for **


 # Styles of naming variables
 # camelCase
 ## NOTE: This style of naming is called camelCase because the uppercase characters
 # that appear in a name may suggest a camel’s humps.
 # kebob_case
 # PascalCase


# camelCase: This naming convention originated in the Smalltalk programming 
# language in the 1970s. It was later adopted by other programming languages 
# like Java, JavaScript, and Python. The name "camelCase" comes from the way 
# the capital letters in the name resemble the humps of a camel.

# kebab-case: This naming convention is also known as "spinal-case" or 
# "dash-case". It is commonly used in web development, particularly in HTML and
#  CSS, where it is used to name CSS classes and HTML attributes. The name 
# "kebab-case" comes from the way the hyphen characters resemble a 
# kebab on a stick.

# PascalCase: This naming convention is named after the Pascal programming 
# language, where it was first used in the 1970s. It is similar to CamelCase, 
# but the first letter of each word is capitalized, including the first word. 
# PascalCase is commonly used in .NET programming languages like C# and VB.NET.


# Variable Reassignment
# Variables are called “variable” because they can reference different values 
# while a program is running. When you assign a value to a variable, 
# the variable will reference that value until you assign it a different value.
